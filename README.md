A PokeDex Web Application 

This Project is a React-based web application that takes data from the Pokemon API and displays over a thousand Pokemon on a webpage. Clicking on the Pokemon Card will pull up a details page with the stats, moves, types, abilities, and description of the Pokemon. To help with navigation there's a previous and next button on all detail pages. 

To use it locally, you will need to have React installed. Install the dependecies using npm install. Cd into PokemonDex and then run npm run dev.
